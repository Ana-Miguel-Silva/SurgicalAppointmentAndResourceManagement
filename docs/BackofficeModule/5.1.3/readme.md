# US 5.1.3


## 1. Context

As part of the development of the software system, it is necessary to implement user management functionalities within the patient interface. These functionalities are essential to allow patients to register in the application and then create a user profile, and book appointmens. 

## 2. Requirements

**US 5.1.3** As a Patient, I want to register for the healthcare application, so that I can create a user profile and book appointments online.

**Acceptance Criteria:** 

- Patients can self-register using the external IAM system.

- During registration, patients provide personal details (e.g., name, email, phone) and create a
profile.

- The system validates the email address by sending a verification email with a confirmation link.
Patients cannot book appointments without completing the registration process.

- Pawword must have at least 10 characters long, at least a digit, a capital letter and a special character

- A patient must be unique in terms of `Medical Record Number`, `Email` and ‘Phone’.

- Sensitive data (like medical history) must comply with GDPR, allowing patients
to control their data access.


- Medical record numbers are generated by the system following the format YYYYMMnnnnnn where YYYY and MM are the year and month of the registration and nnnnnn is a sequential number.


**Customer Specifications and Clarifications:**

> **Question 23:**

> **Answer:** 


**Dependencies/References:**

* There is a dependency to "US 5.1.1- As an Admin, I want to register new backoffice users (e.g., doctors, nurses, technicians, admins) via an out-of-band process, so that they can access the
backoffice system with appropriate permissions."

**Input and Output Data**

**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
    * First Name
    * Last Name
    * E-mail (Contact Information)
    * Phone number (Contact Information)
    * password
    * Date of Birth    
    * Allergies/Medical Conditions (optional)
    * Emergency Contact


* Selected data:
    * Gender

* Generated data:
    * Medical Record Number 

**Output Data:**
* Display the success of the operation and the data of the registered patient

## 3. Analysis

> **Question:** What will be the format of the Medical Record Number generated after recording the data?
>
> **Answer:** mMdical record numbers are generated by the system following the format YYYYMMnnnnnn where YYYY and MM are the year and month of the registration and nnnnnn is a sequential number.


> **Question:**From a usability perspective, dates should be presented to the user using the operating system's locale definitions. since for this sprint you are building an API, you should use a standard format like ISO 8601.
>
> **Answer:** mMdical record numbers are generated by the system following the format YYYYMMnnnnnn where YYYY and MM are the year and month of the registration and nnnnnn is a sequential number.

**Before Tests** **Setup of Dummy Users**

```
    public static SystemUser dummyUser(final String email, final Role... roles) {
        final SystemUserBuilder userBuilder = new SystemUserBuilder(new NilPasswordPolicy(), new PlainTextEncoder());
        return userBuilder.with(email, "duMMy1", "dummy", "dummy", email).build();
    }

    public static SystemUser crocodileUser(final String email, final Role... roles) {
        final SystemUserBuilder userBuilder = new SystemUserBuilder(new NilPasswordPolicy(), new PlainTextEncoder());
        return userBuilder.with(email, "CroC1_", "Crocodile", "SandTomb", email).withRoles(roles).build();
    }

    private SystemUser getNewUserFirst() {
        return dummyUser("dummy@gmail.com", Roles.ADMIN);
    }

    private SystemUser getNewUserSecond() {
        return crocodileUser("crocodile@gmail.com", Roles.OPERATOR);
    }

```

**Test 1:** *Verifies if Users are equals*


```
@Test
public void verifyIfUsersAreEquals() {
    assertTrue(getNewUserFirst().equals(getNewUserFirst()));
}
````


## 5. Implementation


### Methods in the ListUsersController
* **Iterable<SystemUser> filteredUsersOfBackOffice()**  this method filters to list all backoffice users



### Methods in the AddUsersController

* **Role[] getRoleTypes()** this method list the roles to choose for the User

* **SystemUser addUser(final String email, final String password, final String firstName,
  final String lastName, final Set<Role> roles, final Calendar createdOn)**  this method send the information to create the User.

* **String generatePassword()** this method automatically generate a password for the User. 



### Methods in the DeactivateUsersController

* **Iterable<SystemUser> activeUsers()** this method list all the activated Users. 

* **Iterable<SystemUser> deactiveUsers()** this method list all the deactivated Users.

* **SystemUser activateUser(final SystemUser user)** this method activate the chosen User.

* **SystemUser deactivateUser(final SystemUser user)** this method deactivate the chosen User.
