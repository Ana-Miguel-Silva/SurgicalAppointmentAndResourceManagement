# US 5.1.21


## 1. Context

As part of the development of the software system, it is necessary to implement user management functionalities within the administrative interface. These functionalities are essential to allow administrators to edit existing operation types, to update or correct information. 
This is the first time this task has been assigned for development.

## 2. Requirements

**US 5.1.21** As an Admin, I want to edit existing operation types, so that I can update or correct
information about the procedure.

**Acceptance Criteria:** 

- Admins can search for and select an existing operation type to edit.

- Editable fields include operation name, required staff by specialization, and estimated
duration.

- Changes are reflected in the system immediately for future operation requests.

- Historical data is maintained, but new operation requests will use the updated operation type
information.

**Customer Specifications and Clarifications:**

> **Question:**Can you clarify? "Historical data is maintained, but new operation requests will use the updated operation type information."
>
> **Answer:** It means that if an operation type is changed we need to keep track of its changes. For instance,Operation Type "A" is defined as taking 30 minutes preparation, 1h surgery and 30 minutes cleaning with a team of 1 doctor with specialization X and one nurse with specialization Y some operations are requested, scheduled and performed based on this definition after sometime, the hospital changes its procedures and defines the operation type "A" as needing 30 min prep, 30 min. surgery and 30 min. cleaning, with a team of 3 doctors and one nurse.New operations will be requested, scheduled and performed using this new definition, however, we need to keep historical data, so that if the admin wants to know the details of an operation in the past, the system must show the operation type as it was defined at the time of the operation request.



> **Question:** If the operation type already has a specialization associated, how can we have staff with different specializations?
>What do you understand by specialization? Is it cardiology/orthopedics? Or anaesthesist/circulating/...
>
> **Answer:** The operation is mainly associated with one specialization, but for a specific operation it might require a team with multiple specializations.
>Cardiology, orthopedics, anaesthesist are specializations that either doctors or nurses can have.
>The circulating technician is a different type of medical professional. for now the system doesn't need to support technicians


**Dependencies/References:**

* There is a dependency to "US 5.1.1- As an Admin, I want to register new backoffice users (e.g., doctors, nurses, technicians, admins) via an out-of-band process, so that they can access the
backoffice system with appropriate permissions."

**Input and Output Data**

**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
    * Password
    * E-mail


* Selected data:
    * Operation 
    * Operation Type


**Output Data:**
* Display the success of the operation and the changed data.

## 3. Analysis

> **Question 97:** US1000 â€“ Regarding user registration, should these all be considered "enable" by default or should there be an option to "enable/disable" users during the registration process?
>
> **Answer:** In the context of the US1000 it should be possible to activate and deactivate users. I suppose they should be active by default.

### 4.3. Applied Patterns

### 4.4. Tests

Include here the main tests used to validate the functionality. Focus on how they relate to the acceptance criteria.



**Before Tests** **Setup of Dummy Users**

```
    public static SystemUser dummyUser(final String email, final Role... roles) {
        final SystemUserBuilder userBuilder = new SystemUserBuilder(new NilPasswordPolicy(), new PlainTextEncoder());
        return userBuilder.with(email, "duMMy1", "dummy", "dummy", email).build();
    }

    public static SystemUser crocodileUser(final String email, final Role... roles) {
        final SystemUserBuilder userBuilder = new SystemUserBuilder(new NilPasswordPolicy(), new PlainTextEncoder());
        return userBuilder.with(email, "CroC1_", "Crocodile", "SandTomb", email).withRoles(roles).build();
    }

    private SystemUser getNewUserFirst() {
        return dummyUser("dummy@gmail.com", Roles.ADMIN);
    }

    private SystemUser getNewUserSecond() {
        return crocodileUser("crocodile@gmail.com", Roles.OPERATOR);
    }

```

**Test 1:** *Verifies if Users are equals*


```
@Test
public void verifyIfUsersAreEquals() {
    assertTrue(getNewUserFirst().equals(getNewUserFirst()));
}
````


## 5. Implementation


### Methods in the ListUsersController
* **Iterable<SystemUser> filteredUsersOfBackOffice()**  this method filters to list all backoffice users



### Methods in the AddUsersController

* **Role[] getRoleTypes()** this method list the roles to choose for the User

* **SystemUser addUser(final String email, final String password, final String firstName,
  final String lastName, final Set<Role> roles, final Calendar createdOn)**  this method send the information to create the User.

* **String generatePassword()** this method automatically generate a password for the User. 



### Methods in the DeactivateUsersController

* **Iterable<SystemUser> activeUsers()** this method list all the activated Users. 

* **Iterable<SystemUser> deactiveUsers()** this method list all the deactivated Users.

* **SystemUser activateUser(final SystemUser user)** this method activate the chosen User.

* **SystemUser deactivateUser(final SystemUser user)** this method deactivate the chosen User.
