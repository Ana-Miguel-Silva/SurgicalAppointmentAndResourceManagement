# US 5.1.2


## 1. Context

As part of the development of the software system, it is necessary to implement a functionality that lets a user reset their password.
This is the first time this task has been assigned for development.


## 2. Requirements

**US 5.1.2** 

**Acceptance Criteria:** 

- Backoffice users can request a password reset by providing their email.
- The system sends a password reset link via email.
- The reset link expires after a predefined period (e.g., 24 hours) for security.
- Users must provide a new password that meets the systemâ€™s password complexity rules.

**Dependencies/References:**

* There is a dependency to "5.1.1", since is necessary to have a User Account to be able to change its password.

**Input and Output Data**

**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
    * Email
    * Password


**Output Data:**
* Display the success of the sending an Email to the user.
* Display the success of updating the Password after filling the form in the link provided via email.

## 3. Analysis

> **Question:** What are the system's password requirements?
>
> **Answer:** At least 10 characters long, at least a digit, a capital letter and a special character

### 4.2. Tests

Include here the main tests used to validate the functionality. Focus on how they relate to the acceptance criteria.

**Before Tests** **Setup of Dummy Users**
