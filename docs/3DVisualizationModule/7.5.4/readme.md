# US 7.5.4


## 1. Context

As part of the development of the software system, it is necessary to implement user management functionalities within the 3D module. 

## 2. Requirements

**7.5.4** As a healthcare staff member, whenever I select a different room, I want the camera (and the spotlight, if applicable) to move smoothly instead of instantly. The animation can either be created or defined using some API, such as tween.js

**Acceptance Criteria:** 


**Customer Specifications and Clarifications:**


**Dependencies/References:**

* There is a dependency to "7.5.1- As a healthcare staff member, I want to select a room by left clicking on the
  corresponding surgical table (object picking). The camera should instantly move horizontally so that it targets the room center point"
